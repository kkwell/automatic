\page ExPdfExport Exporting a Drawing to PDF

To export a document to PDF, we can use the printing framework of QCAD
which is itself implemented in ECMAScript. To do this, we simply include 
the class Print:

To print or export a drawing to PDF, we need a visual representation of
the drawing first. This is achieved through a graphics scene with an 
attached view:

\snippet ExPdfExport.jsd view

In most cases, we need to configure the page size, scale factor and
other settings before we can produce a usable PDF output. This is done
by setting various custom variables in our document. Not that a document
might already have these settings, for example if it was previously 
printed or exported in QCAD.

The actual export is done through function 'print':
