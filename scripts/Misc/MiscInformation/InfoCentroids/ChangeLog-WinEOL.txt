Preface:
=========
A centroid in 2D is merely a point in X&Y where all the mass would be condensed in an infinite small point.
Because a point has no dimensions, one would not be able to give it other properties.
    Whatever times zero results in nothing.
We only assume that it has a mass as a distinct property.

Another property would directly relate to the origin of the centroid.
In 2D that is limited to a certain infinite thin area or to a certain length of an infinite thin wire.

A centroid its mass is then proportional related to its area in 2D or to its length in 1D.
    For simplicity expressed as a unitless factor 'Weighted'.
    Generalized, the weight that each of the properties has when combining multiple components.

The centroid point its mass only differs in how the value for the mass is obtained:
- From a certain calculated area times a given uniform areal density.
- From a certain length of wire(s) times a given uniform linear density.
- Of a given point mass or the mass from combining other 2D Centroids their data.
    Again simplifying an additional required 'Density' property as a unitless value.

Depending their nature, densities are to be expressed per drawing units or per squared drawing units.
All mass or density values must be expressed in the same unit of mass.
The individual custom density can be set by changing the custom property of the marker.

There are no restrictions on adding various other custom properties to a 2D Centroid marker.
In QCAD custom properties are simple textual notes.
One could add material specifications e.g.:
    'Material : Plywood' & 'Thickness in Z : 19mm' & 'Density (vol.) : 680 kg/m³ or 0.00068g/mm³' ...
    The areal density of this material would be 19mm times 0.00068g/mm³ = 0,01292 in g/mm².
Analogue for the linear density of wires.

For the ease of use one can enter equations without doing calculations on forehand.

FAQ:
- The area method takes a single selection while the wire method takes any selected line-art as entry.
  A multiple area selection can have nested or overlapping contours aside of no solution for the area
    of line segments, the difference between an arc as sector or as arc segment and so on.
  Up to this point, a single or multiple contours method is not implemented.
  The workaround is by a hatched area, a polyline or combining individual centroids of open/closed shapes.
  In the last context a void can be regarded as a negative density and mass.

- Why are they not implemented as common properties of entities?
  There are several reasons:
  - The ambiguous nature explained above.
  - Splines and ellipse arc wires require integration and tend to be too slow as property.
    The finer this is done by a vast amount of tiny sub values the more accurate the result. (Up to a point!)
    It may take several seconds for one and thus several hundreds of seconds for a drawing with 100 splines.
  - To evaluate to a point mass an additional areal/linear density value is required.

Changed in InfoCentroids version 0.32:
=======================================
- All QCAD Professional add-ons for QCAD framework 3.27 and later.
    Otherwise, the add-ons are not loaded and initiated.
- Cleared all shortcut key sequences as there was discovered another conflict with ModifyToolsPanel (WM).
    Found no good alternatives.
- 2D Centroids as a coherent sub menu of the Misc Information menu.
- Centroids markers are now one single (odd shaped) polyline.
    Easier to select but this has a drawback when snapping.
    Before, the extra circle had a nice and easy center/middle snapping point.
- Implemented a new point mass 2D Centroid marker type.
    As known plain point mass or as the weighted sum of combining others centroids their data.
- Implemented a small tool for adding 2D centroids with given mass at indicated position,
    fully customizable by dialog.
- Somewhat updated the preparations for translations.
    A major drawback is that custom properties are not auto-translated by the Property Editor.
    2D Centroids are thus native language specific and can't be handled in a different language.
- Implemented a custom property change listener for 2D centroids.
    When active, this will try to bind any change made to the values 'Density' or 'Point mass'.
    It will also bind any translation of the marker by updating the 'position X/Y' values.
    The custom properties for the 'Weighted' value, together with the values for X and Y are the
      recorded textual results of a calculation of an area or a wire centroid. These are not tied
      to anything in the drawing and should not be changed except in very controlled situations.
      e.g.: For translating them over to a cross sectional or side view.
    2 drawbacks:
    - A transaction listener will listen to any change that is applied to a drawing.        Initially always inactive and preferable turned on/off as required.
    - All is part of a circular relationship, adapting to an input may change the input again.
        As a workaround, the marker(s) in question are deselected after a change is applied.
- 'Density' or 'Point mass' can be expressed as simple equations. e.g. '(a*b)+(c*d)-d ...'
    With all numerical values, preferable with the application decimal point but not strictly required.
    For the above example one enters the text "19*0,00068" or "19*0.00068" what evaluates to 0.01292.
    A thousand separator is not supported and may result in invalid results.
- Numbers for mass, area and length on the Command History are now with the recently added
    application preference for decimal digits in the Property Editor.
- Reporting the summed area or length when combining equal types.
    This does not take into account overlapping and/or nested nature.
- Several minor changes and tweaks.
    e.g. Advancing the selection to the added marker.
- Synchronized with related commits by Andrew.


Changed in InfoCentroids version 0.31:
=======================================
- Circles from hatch boundary bug fix. (version 0.11)
- Checks for QCAD framework >= 3.26.4.5 and adapts. (version 0.13) (Removed v0.32)
    Ifso, excluding all (autoClosed) self-intersection shapes.
    Reports first intersection that is found.
- Excludes polyline with widths and circles and thus its own markers. (Deprecated v0.32)
- Changed proportional character of markers.
- Centralized critical error handling.

- Labels number formatting, decimal point and precision by drawing preferences. (Bug fix)
    List separator by common sense.
- Command History decimal point, list separator and precision by QCAD general preferences.
    Position is in full floating point notation with 17 significant digits.
    What is re-usable as an 'exact' Cartesian position string.
- Added marker custom properties full 17 significant digits values.
    Later to be summed weighted with their individual custom densities.
    Refer to the InfoSumCentroidsWeighted Addon.

- All closed format equations for ellipses and ellipse arcs area & area centroids.
- Improved integration for ellipses:
    For arc wire 2D Centroids: At least 4096 arc segments/full ellipse are used.
    As or as part of a hatch boundary: At least 1024 arc segments/full ellipse are used.
- Nearly exact full ellipse circumference by two distinct fast converging infinite series expansions.
    For more details see notes inside the function declarations: getFullEllipseWireCentroid,
    getFullEllipseCircumISC and getFullEllipseCircumISGK.
- Improved location stability, shapes are mostly handled as if they were encircling the origin.
- Implemented 'A generalized Kahan–Babuška-Summation-Algorithm' proposed by Klein.
    Running sums can have a poor accuracy due to loss of significance.
    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm

- Included uniform density area 2D Centroid in sector mode for (ellipse) arcs by a hidden switch.
    See QCAD.ini/conf after an initial use.
- Included separate class for uniform density wire methods.
    The wire method handles single and multi-selections of any line-art.
    In normal use one would not mix the results of those above.
    Still, all three types of centroids can be summed weighted.

- Misc .. Information menu as adopted by Andrew. (Updated v0.32)
    Keeping in mind that QCAD supports user toolbars.
- Reverted to shortcuts: (Deprecated all v0.32)
    'AM' aka Area center of Mass
    'WM' aka Wire(s) center of Mass
    'CM' aka Combine centers of Mass

- For the scripters: All methods reverted to RShapes
